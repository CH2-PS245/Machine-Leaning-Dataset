Importing Libraries:
--
```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import keras
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import random
```
This code imports the TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Random, and Skelearn libraries, which are commonly used for machine learning and numerical computations.


Installing Libraries:
--
```
!pip install [library-name]
```
These lines use the !pip install command to install Python libraries.


Saving the Trained Model:
--
```
model.save("model.h5")
```
This line saves the trained model as an HDF5 file named "model.h5". The model was likely trained using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow.
